          <p>Hi! This is a pastebin application just like pastebin.com except here you can paste colourful html content
            as
            well.</p>

          <p>I made this primarily to share logs from text games I play, mostly <a href="http://www.achaea.com/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Achaea</a>. I know there are a lot of other such solutions but... either
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>they don't support pasting in html</li>
            <li>require you to <span class="text-danger">login</span> when they do</li>
            <li>or make you <span class="text-danger">upload a file</span></li>
            <li>... something else I found <span class="text-danger">annoying</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here the focus is on <span class="text-success">simplicity and utility</span>. Auto-focus on the paste
            field
            with keyboard accelerators means <span class="text-success">mouse free operation</span>.</p>

          <p>No required fields means you can paste, hit ctrl-enter (or alt-enter if it's html) and you're done!</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What is the Acceptable Use Policy?</h3>
      <p>This site is mostly meant for game logs but it can serve as a general purpose pastebin as well. For that, I'll
        just reiterate <a href="http://pastebin.com/faq#5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastebin.com's policy</a>
        here.
      </p>
      <p class="text-danger">Please do NOT post:</p>
      <ul class="text-danger">
        <li>email lists</li>
        <li>login details</li>
        <li>stolen source code</li>
        <li>password lists</li>
        <li>personal information / data</li>
        <li>pornographic information / data</li>
        <li>spam links (this includes promoting your own site)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="WhenDoesStuffExpire">When does stuff expire?</h3>
      <p>
        Pastes are considered for deletion after about 180 days have passed since they were last viewed.
        You can delete a paste you made yourself too if you're seeing the delete button on it! The
        application remembers the last ten pastes made from your computer in the form of
        <a href="#PrivacyPolicy">cookies</a>.

        <a href="#PasteToGoogleDrive">Google Drive hosted content</a> is kept for as long as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>What happens if I sign in?</h3>
      <p>
        Signing in allows you to manage your pastes. Specifically, it lets you delete your pastes regardless of the
        expiry schedule.
      </p>

      <h3>I pasted in html but I'm seeing the html source?</h3>
      <p>You need to click on the 'Colourful HTML' button to flag your paste as html content before pasting.</p>

      <h3>How do I make private pastes?</h3>
      <p>Just don't add any tags to your paste and it won't appear in the search results.</p>

      <h3>What is the max paste size?</h3>
      <p>
        The maximum size a paste can be is 2000 kilobytes (~2 megabytes). You can try to paste more too, but anything
        beyond that is compressed. The paste is rejected if it's still over 2000 kilobytes after compression.
      </p>

      <div class="section">
      <h1 id="PasteToGoogleDrive" class="text-decoration-underline mb-5">Paste to Google Drive!</h1>
      <p>Hi again! It's possible to paste your things straight to your Google Drive now! Here's a rundown of how it
        works:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Paste/Write something in the big box!
        </li>
        <li>
          Select from Plain Text / Colourful HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the Google Drive datastore option (<img src="//{{ static_domain }}/static/img/drive.webp"
            height="16" width="16" alt="Google Drive" loading="lazy">) and click Paste it!
        </li>
        <li>
          This will open a window asking for your consent, you need a Google Account to sign in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>The consent screen would have the following permission listed in there:</div>
          <ul>
            <li><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="//{{ static_domain }}/static/img/drive_rfp.webp"
              height="74" width="420" alt="Google Drive permissions" loading="lazy"></li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            This permission grants the application access to files and folders it created <em>itself</em> only. You can
            read more about it <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth"
              title="About Authorization &nbsp;|&nbsp; Drive REST API &nbsp;|&nbsp; Google Developers"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!
          </div>
          <div>
            Sometimes you may see an permission called 'Have Offline Access', that's a thing with Google APIs when you
            request a permission which was already granted before. Offline access is not required nor used by the
            application.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have granted access, you should start seeing a folder called <strong>Pastebin!!</strong> in your
          Google
          Drive!
        </li>
        <li>
          You can disconnect your Google Drive any time by going to Settings &gt; Manage Apps or from your <a
            href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security#connectedapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            My Account page</a>. Disconnecting the
          application does not remove content from you Google Drive unless you delete it yourself.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Why should I connect my Google Drive at all?</h3>
      <p>I can think of FIVE really good reasons!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One, you get to manage your content yourself. Lookit it, change it, download it, even delete it!
        </li>
        <li>
          Two! You use up your own storage quota and free up space available to the application!
        </li>
        <li>
          Three! Your pastes no longer expire after 180 days. No more expiring content!
        </li>
        <li>
          Four! Your pastes can be a lot bigger if they're going to your massive Google Drive instead of my tiny little
          datastore!
        </li>
        <li>
          Five! You get an adorable little icon on each of your Google Drive hosted content proclaiming of its
          longetivity!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Clicking on the <strong>Paste to Google Drive!</strong> button does nothing?</h3>
      <p>You need to have some content in the big box before attempting to paste.</p>

      <h3>I disconnected my Google Drive and reconnected again, now I'm seeing TWO Pastebin!! folders?!</h3>
      <p>
        When an application connects to Google Drive, all the files it creates are marked as its property and made
        available to it. However, when you disconnect, all those files no longer carry that mark and are consequently no
        longer available to the application. When you reconnect, the application tries to look for its folder, can't
        find
        it (it's no longer its property, remember?) and proceeds to make a new folder. And that's how you have two
        Pastebin!! folders now!
      </p>

      <h3>I deleted something from my Google Drive but it's still appearing in the application?!</h3>
      <p>
        Oh, Google Drive will serve a file even if it's sitting in your Trash. Delete it from there as well!
      </p>

      <h3>I deleted it from Trash as well but it's still appearing in the application?!</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Oops, it's probably still in the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-caching/"
          title="What is Caching? | How is a Website Cached?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cache</a>! Give
          it a few hours and it'll poof from there as well on its own.

        <p>Last updated: 2025-12-26</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for using this application! I try to keep things simple, transparent, and respectful of your privacy.
          This part explains what data is collected, how it's used, and how cookies and third-party services fit into
          the picture.

        <h2>What Data This Application Collects</h2>
        <p>
          This application only collects the information you choose to provide, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The text, HTML, or other content you paste</li>
          <li>Optional metadata you add (titles, tags, etc.)</li>
          <li>A cryptographic hash of your Discord identity if you sign in</li>
          <li>Temporary OAuth credentials when saving to Google Drive (explained below)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No other personal information is collected. No email addresses, profile details, or unique identifiers from
          Google or Discord are stored.
        </p>

        <h2>How Sign-In Works</h2>

        <h3>Discord Sign-In</h3>
        <p>
          If you choose to sign in with Discord:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>cryptographic hash</strong> of your Discord user ID is stored.</li>
          <li>This hash is <strong>irreversible</strong> and cannot be used to recover your Discord identity.</li>
          <li>The hash is used only to establish ownership of your pastes so you can delete them later.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Google Drive Integration</h3>
        <p>
          When you save content to Google Drive:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The application requests the <strong>minimum OAuth scope</strong> needed to create a file.</li>
          <li>The application <strong>does not receive your email address</strong> or any personal profile information.</li>
          <li>The OAuth token is <strong>single-use</strong> and discarded immediately after the upload.</li>
          <li>The application cannot access or view any other files in your Google Drive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Files created through the application are set to <strong>“anyone with the link can view.”</strong>
          The application stores only the link so it can display your content when requested. The share link is never revealed
          to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application <strong>cannot delete</strong> files from your Google Drive because it does not store any information
          that identifies your Google account.
        </p>

        <p>
          This application uses a few cookies to make things work smoothly:

          <li>Discord identity hashes remain only as long as your associated content exists.</li>
          <li>
            No server logs containing personal data are retained beyond what is necessary for basic operation and security.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Delete Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          You can delete your pastes at any time:
        </p>

          <li>If you're signed in, you can delete any paste you created.</li>
          <li>If you're not signed in, you can delete any of your last ten pastes using the delete button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For Google Drive uploads, you can delete the file directly from your Google Drive.
